The essence of this machine learning project is to train a machine to predict with a good level of accuracy whether flights (popular US local Airlines) to and from popular destinations will be delayed or not on arrival. I would try to implement a solution to this problem using a binary classification method (logistic regression) to work.


Import the data set
Do data preprocessing
Do some visulaizations
Split the dataset
Apply  ML binary classification algorithm on the training data
Make prediction with the test data
Measure algorithm performance
Tune the regularisation parameter to improve performance of the algorithm
